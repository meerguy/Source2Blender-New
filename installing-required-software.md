## BSPSource, Crowbar and GCFScape

These programs are either unpacked into folders or have an installer. Just go to their download links by clicking their names in the section theyâ€™re referred to. Theyâ€™re programs that run outside Blender, and not as Add-ons.

The list for these three programs can be found here:

1. BSPSource: [https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases](https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases)
2. Crowbar: [https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool)

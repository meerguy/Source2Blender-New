# ‚ùî A Detailed Explanation

## VPKS

VPK (Valve Pak) files are uncompressed archives used to package game content. Valve's post GCF games store materials, models, particles, choreography scenes and many other file types in VPK files.

## MDLS

MDL is the extension for [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source)'s proprietary model format. It defines the structure of the model along with animation, bounding box, hit box, materials, mesh and [LOD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/LOD) information. It does not, however, contain _all_ the information needed for the model. Additional data is stored in [PHY](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/PHY), [ANI](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/ANI), [VTX](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTX) and [VVD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VVD) files, and sometimes, usually for shared animations, other .mdl files.
